            <strong>Pesto</strong> is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital 
            city of Liguria, Italy. Dating back to the Roman times, pesto traces its name to the Italian word
            <em>pestare</em>, meaning <em>to crush or pound</em> as the sauce 
            was made by pounding the ingredients in a mortar and pestle.

            This is a modified version with coconut 
            cream instead of hard cheeses.
